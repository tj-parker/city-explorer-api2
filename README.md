# City Explorer Api

**Author**: TJ Parker
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview

A custom API server which will provide data for the City Explorer front-end application. This means users will get to see not only the map, but also interesting information about the area, provided by a variety of third-party APIs that the server will manage.
